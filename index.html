    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
      knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are
      <strong>at least a billion people</strong>
      who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement,

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
